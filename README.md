### Lecture 1 Notes:

**Declarative vs Imperative**
- Declarative is statements of facts :cop: :scroll:
- Imperative is "How To" step by step, like receipe :pencil2: :musical_score:

**Stored program computer vs Fixed program computer**
- Stored program computer is Turing Machine + The von Neumann architecture (i am stretching it here...)
- Fixed program is one machine built to do one thing, like the Enigma machine

Stored program computer treats data and instructions (programs) as the same thing

**Well-formed tring vs semantic meaning**
*I are big* is well-formed, but no semantic meaning
>Syntax determines whether a string is legal, static semantics determine whether the string has meaning, and semantics assigns a meaning to a legal sentence (assuming no static semantic errors).

**All programs are interpreted for the computer**

Compiled programs convert source code to **object code** then feed it to interpreter.

**Three types of errors of a program**
1. crash
2. run forever
3. give the wrong answer
