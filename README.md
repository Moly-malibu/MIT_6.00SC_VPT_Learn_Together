>Programming is the most fun you can have with your clothes on... --John Guttag from Lecture 1

## Jan 12th 2019 Meetup @ NUS-ALSET

### Lecture 1 Notes:

**Declarative vs Imperative**
- Declarative is statements of facts :cop: :scroll:
- Imperative is "How To" step by step, like receipe :pencil2: :musical_score:

**Stored program computer vs Fixed program computer**
- Stored program computer is Turing Machine + The von Neumann architecture (i am stretching it here...)
- Fixed program is one machine built to do one thing, like the Enigma machine

Stored program computer treats data and instructions (programs) as the same thing

**Well-formed tring vs semantic meaning**

*I are big* is well-formed, but no semantic meaning*
>Syntax determines whether a string is legal, static semantics determine whether the string has meaning, and semantics assigns a meaning to a legal sentence (assuming no static semantic errors).


**Alan Turing showed that there are 6 primitive instructions each of which operated on one bit of information. And with those 6 primitive instructions you can do anything that can be done with a computer**


**Programming languages are just providing a set of primitive instructions (>= 6), a set of primitive control structures**
- set of primitive instructions
- flow of control, or mechanisms to control the order instructions are executed

**All programs are interpreted for the computer**

Compiled programs convert source code to **object code** then feed it to interpreter.

**Three types of errors of a program**
1. crash
2. run forever
3. give the wrong answer

### Lecture 2 Notes:

**Types**

are classifications of objects. In Python, everything is an object, **even the Python code itself is an object. For stored-program computers, a program is just data, just like a number is data. Each object has a type.**

**Straight line program vs Branching program**

Straight line program goes through the program line-by-line and carries out each step. Branching program can run different sections depending on the conditions.
